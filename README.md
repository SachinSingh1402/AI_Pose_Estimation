# Bicep Curl Counter using Mediapipe and OpenCV

This project uses the Mediapipe library to detect human poses in real-time and count bicep curls. The system tracks the position of key landmarks on the user's arm to calculate the angle between the shoulder, elbow, and wrist. When the angle indicates a full curl (from the arm fully extended to fully bent), the counter increments.
